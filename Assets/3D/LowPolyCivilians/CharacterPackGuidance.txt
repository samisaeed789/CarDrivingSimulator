Low Poly Civilian Pack Guidance

1.) All character and weapon models are FBX Scale of 1.0 in Unity. They were designed at real world scale using Meters. Make sure all model files are set to 1.0 (including animation model files).

2.) I have bundled in the "Vertex Colored" shader in the Unity package. This will allow for a material that uses the model's vertex coloring for shading, etc. It's the cheapest solution for mobile usage, by avoiding using dynamic lighting.

3.) For Character Texture Variation, please find the Materials folder, and apply different materials to the models you want to have different looks. By default the characters use the first material available. You'll have to go in and apply materials manually or change them at runtime via script for variations in the characters. You also have the option of simply using the prefabs I've created. They already have each unique material and texture applied to each variation.

4.) Supplemental to the notes above. I would suggest creating prefabs for each character variation, each applied with their own unique material/texture. This way you have the means to access each and every character variation easily. *You can use the prefabs I've already created.

5.) The characters utilize Unity's built in "@" functionality for animations. Any character file with the model name suffixed by "@" + animation name will automatically apply the animations to the main character model. It's a very versatile way to allow for easy editing of individual animations without have to split animations on a single model. I've found splitting animations can produce animation glitches if animation compression is used. By default animation compression is applied, but if you need cleaner animation turn it off. Make sure to check file sizes for animations as well. Compression can reduce the file sizes, but might introduce artifacts.
